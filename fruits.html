                    <p>Orange juice is probably the best option because it's nutritious, easy to find and not as expensive as more exotic juices. It's high in vitamin C, folate and minerals.</p>
                <p>Pomegranate juice is another excellent choice because it's high in potassium, magnesium and B vitamins.</p>
                <p>Pink grapefruit juice is also a good diet choice as long as you opt for juice that's not sweetened with added sugar.Fruit juice contains vitamins, minerals, and beneficial compounds that sugary soda typically lacks (16Trusted Source).

Against popular belief, 1/2 cup (120 ml) of fruit juice is just as rich in most vitamins and minerals, including iron, potassium, magnesium, and B vitamins, as the same quantity of fresh fruit</p>
